# Will It Rain
A web app that gets information from Open Weather API and gets straight to the point, answering the question: will It rain today?

This program uses vanilla javascript to fetch rain data from the Open Weather API. The next 48 Hrs of rain data are displayed with an easy to understand colour-coded three tier system - "Drizzle", "Moderate Rain", or "Heavy Rain". The user can change to their local city and see weather or not they need to take an umbrella out with them today.

This project was made as part of a learning experience, needing to practise using APIs after completing the Udemy Course "Modern Javascrip from the Beginning" by Brad Traversy. 

The idea for this app came to me when I realised that usually when I look up the weather it is because I want to find out if it is going to be too wet or not. I like to partake in outdoor sports including cycling and skateboarding, and I was uninterested in temperature, humidity or wind speed, I just wanted to know the answer to one simple question: will it rain today?
